# Iron Accord Society

## Daily Life
Inside Iron Accord territory, routines center around ritual, discipline, and respect for tradition. Most people wake early, focusing on repairs, patrols, and shared meals. Children are taught skills by mentors and elders. Pride in skilled work is constant, and everyone is expected to contribute.

## Social Structure
Authority comes from the Guilds and the Accord Council. Every settlement has a council, chosen by action rather than inheritance or wealth. The blacksmith, healer, and scout all have a voice. Reputation holds real weight. People gain respect by proving they are useful, trustworthy, or courageous. Outsiders might be welcomed, but only after showing their loyalty.

## Law and Order
Iron Accord law is clear, posted in every settlement square, and enforced by Marshals and volunteers. Theft and betrayal are met with consequences that may include extra work or, for serious offenses, exile. Most disputes are settled publicly, giving both sides a chance to speak. There is room for forgiveness, but those who repeat their offenses are quickly left on their own.

## Customs and Festivals
The Accord values tradition. Communities hold shared meals after harvests and gather to honor those who have died. There are competitions for metalwork, storytelling events, and group repairs that help build trust. These gatherings keep history alive and give people a sense of belonging.

## Attitude Toward Technology
Technology is met with suspicion. Anything more advanced than clockwork or simple steam is usually broken down, buried, or locked away. Some engineers, called Ciphers, can study old machines under careful supervision, always working in groups. The Machine Fall left deep scars, and older generations pass down stories as warnings for the young.

## Military and Defense
Everyone is expected to help defend their home if trouble comes. Marshals maintain order, scouts keep watch, and all able-bodied adults know how to use basic weapons. The Accord avoids starting conflicts, but when forced to fight, their training and organization show through.

## Relations with Others
Iron Accord members are cautious around outsiders, especially anyone with cybernetics or advanced tech. Trade with Neon Dharma is limited and tightly monitored. Travelers from unclaimed lands are questioned, but not rejected without reason. Spies and thieves are dealt with swiftly.
