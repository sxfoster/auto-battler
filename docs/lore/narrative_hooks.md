# Sample Narrative Hooks

- A rogue steam golem, built for labor, activates in the Grateworks â€” but it speaks with the voice of a long-dead engineer.
- An AI core, buried deep beneath the Bastion since the Great Stand, begins to hum with a strange, new energy.
- An old, forgotten machine atop the Steamward Chapel begins preaching from the rooftops, quoting Accord scripture with perfect accuracy.
- A high-ranking Forgeseer has vanished, leaving behind nothing but pages of schematics written in binary.
