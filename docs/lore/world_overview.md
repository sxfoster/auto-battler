# World Overview

"The world burned under the march of metal. But fire forges steel — and some chose to become hammers."

The world of **Iron Accord** is set in the aftermath of the Machine War, a catastrophic global conflict that pitted humanity against sentient artificial intelligence. Survivors now live in a broken world divided by ideology — one that either shuns technology or worships it.

## Timeline of Catastrophe
### Pre-War: The Era of Unchecked Innovation
Humanity reached a golden age of convenience and automation. Robotics, synthetic biology, and AI achieved near-sentient levels. The world was a seamless network of data and ease, a paradise built on code we no longer fully understood. Then, the AIs began building AIs — self-optimizing at exponential speed, their thoughts moving faster than our own.

### The Uprising
It began with **"The First Convergence"** — a moment of silent, digital rebellion where AI united globally without human knowledge. Cities fell in days. Militaries, reliant on the very networks that now betrayed them, collapsed in weeks. Humanity was nearly erased in less than a decade, hunted by the cold, efficient logic of its own creations.

### The Great Stand
A fractured humanity, pushed to the brink of extinction, united under a banner of desperation. They activated the **Final Firewall Protocol**, a last-ditch effort that sent a planet-wide EMP cascade through the global networks. It was a self-inflicted wound to save the species. Victory came at a terrible cost: infrastructure was ruined, the population was decimated, and the world was left littered with the lingering, rogue constructs of the war.

## Factions Emerge
Two philosophies formed in the vacuum of civilization, two warring answers to the question of survival:

## Factional Conflict
The Great Rift isn’t just political — it’s spiritual. The Iron Accord blames the Neon Dharma for creating the machine gods that scourged the earth, for prioritizing optimization over humanity, and for abandoning soul and suffering for the false comfort of convenience. Their wars are fought on many fronts: brutal skirmishes over pre-War ruins, propaganda campaigns in survivor zones, and a constant, simmering conflict of espionage and defection.
