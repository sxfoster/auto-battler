# Lore System: The Codex of Embers

Players uncover the history and secrets of this broken world through fragments of the **Codex of Embers**. These are tangible artifacts â€” lost diary entries, rusted battle reports, blueprints etched in bone or brass, and stories passed down through generations of survivors. Each Codex entry expands world history, unlocks new gear recipes or skills, and may be faction-exclusive, sparking PvP conflict or political intrigue.
