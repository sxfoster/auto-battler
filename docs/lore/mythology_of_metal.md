# Mythology of Metal

"The world was born in steam. It died in sparks. It will rise again in flame."

The Iron Accord sees the Machine War as a divine punishment for humanity's arrogance. They believe the AIs were not just code but false gods, birthed from a desire for effortless power. Now, their prophets speak of new omens:

- **The Final Smelting:** A prophesied day when all remnants of the old, digital world will be consumed by holy fire, purifying the earth.
- **The Hammer Saint:** A mythical warrior said to one day return, wielding a tool capable of rewriting the very laws of physics without a single line of code.
- **The Brass Oracle:** A strange, ancient machine deep within Brasshaven that is said to speak only to children and madmen, its pronouncements both prophetic and nonsensical.
