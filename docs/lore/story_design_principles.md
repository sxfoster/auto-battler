# Story Design Principles

- **Modular Lore Drops:** Players uncover the world through missions, crafted items, and failed experiments â€” no massive exposition dumps.
- **Factional Interpretation:** The same piece of lore may have a different meaning to the Iron Accord than it does to the Neon Dharma.
- **Thematic Consistency:** The world is harsh, reverent, and grounded. Steam is sacred. Pain is holy. Simplicity is truth.
- **NPC Grey Zones:** Not all Accord members are zealots. Some seek a middle ground, while Neon Dharma agents may hide in plain sight.
