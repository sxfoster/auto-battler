# Iron Accord – MVP Three‑Phase Rollout Strategy

This document summarizes the staged rollout plan for the Iron Accord Discord bot. Each phase adds new features and AI integration to gradually build the game loop.

## Phase 1: Core System (Common Tier Only)
- **Objective:** Prove that the basic mission loop works and establish Codex and survival mechanics.
- **Resources:**
  - 5 scripted Codex entries
  - ~8–10 pieces of starting gear (common tier)
  - 3 fully designed missions
- **Commands:** `/mission`, `/codex`, `/inventory`, `/rest`, `/equip`
- **Tech Focus:**
  - GPT agents drive Codex, inventory, and mission logic
  - PHP/MySQL handle item stats and mission progress
  - Discord bot acts as the primary interface
  - Prototype GM commands: `/trigger`, `/fail`, `/modify`

## Phase 2: Gear & Mechanics Expansion
- **Objective:** Add reward depth and introduce crafting and durability systems.
- **Adds:**
  - Uncommon and Rare gear tiers
  - Basic crafting recipes
  - Item upgrade and repair logic
  - Durability decay with Codex‑infused flavor
  - Mission environmental modifiers (steam, gas, cold)
- **Tech Focus:**
  - GPT‑assisted item generation and dynamic loot tables
  - AI balance testing and stat/flavor synergy prompts

## Phase 3: Adaptive World & AI Layer
- **Objective:** Introduce emergent narrative elements and advanced AI features.
- **Adds:**
  - Dynamically generated missions
  - Procedural Codex entries tied to narrative arcs
  - NPC dialogue via lightweight local models
  - Visual outputs from mission logs (image generation)
- **Tech Focus:**
  - Codex agents suggest story expansions
  - GPT‑4o or local agents create item variants
  - Player choices influence generated missions
  - Begin an exportable React/WebGL frontend

## Codex Agent Integration Concepts
| GPT Agent Use Case      | MVP Phase | Tooling Suggestion                     |
|-------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| Codex entry creation    | Phase 1   | GPT‑4o or prompt‑style lore builder    |
| Item generator          | Phase 2   | Codex prompts for weapons/armor/tools |
| Dialogue/NPC assistant  | Phase 3   | GPT‑4o or local wrapper               |
| Auto‑mission designer   | Phase 3   | Task GPT agent to build mission threads|







MVP THREE-PHASE ROLLOUT STRATEGY (Iron Accord)
📦 Phase 1: CORE SYSTEM (Common Tier Only)
Objective: Prove the game loop works, Codex + survival mechanics feel engaging, and players identify with faction/lore
Resources:

Codex entries (5 fully scripted)

Starting gear (common, ~8–10 items)

Missions (3 fully designed)

Commands: /mission, /codex, /inventory, /rest, /equip

Tech Focus:

✅ Use GPT agents to script logic (Codex, inventory, quest trees)

✅ Leverage PHP/MySQL for item stat handling & mission progress

✅ Discord bot acts as core game interface

⚙️ Prototype GM commands (/trigger, /fail, /modify)

🧩 Phase 2: GEAR + MECHANICS EXPANSION
Objective: Add complexity to reward loops, survival management, and tactical loadouts
Adds:

💠 Uncommon + Rare gear

🧪 Crafting system (basic recipes)

🛠 Item upgrade/repair logic

🧬 Durability decay & Codex-infused item flavor

☣️ Mission environmental modifiers (steam, gas, cold)

Tech Focus:

GPT-agent assisted item generation (/generate item IronAccord rare armor)

Dynamic loot tables

AI-assisted balance testing

Use GenAI to describe gear prompts and flavor + stat synergy

🎮 Phase 3: ADAPTIVE WORLD + AI LAYER
Objective: Introduce emergent narrative + full-scale GenAI interaction
Adds:

🤖 Dynamic missions

📖 Procedural Codex entries tied to long-form narrative arcs

🎭 NPCs powered by lightweight LLMs or fine-tuned assistants

🎥 Begin building visual outputs (Stable Diffusion, Sora-like prompts) from mission logs

Tech Focus:

Codex agents suggest story expansions

GPT-4o or local Codex agent auto-generates item variants

Player input + story arc alters generated missions

Exportable frontend begins development (React, WebGL, LLM-to-prompt)

🛠 Codex (GPT Agent) Integration Concepts
GPT Agent Use Case	MVP Phase	Tooling Suggestion
Codex Entry Creation	✅ Phase 1	Use GPT-4o / prompt-style lore builder
Item Generator	✅ Phase 2	Codex prompts for weapons/armor/tools
Dialogue/NPC Assistant	🚀 Phase 3	GPT-4o or DeepSeek LLM local wrapper
Auto-Mission Designer	🚀 Phase 3	Task GPT agent to build threads from Codex
