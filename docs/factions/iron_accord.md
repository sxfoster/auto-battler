# Iron Accord

- **Location:** **Brasshaven** – a sprawling megacity built in the soot-stained ruins of old industrial hubs across Eurasia.
- **Philosophy:** Reject all forms of sentient or semi-sentient machines. Embrace faith, manual labor, and mechanical purity.
- **Governing Body:** *The Conclave of Steel* – a religious-technocratic council of engineers and zealots.
- **Cultural Symbol:** The Hammer and Flame.

#### Core Beliefs
- "Metal serves man — not replaces him."
- "Precision is faith. Discipline is power."
- "Progress killed the world. Simplicity will rebuild it."

#### Technological Guidelines
The Accord permits only mechanical tools — gears, steam, and pressure systems. There are no processors, no synthetic logic, and no neural networks. Steam-run automatons are allowed, but only under the strict, ritualistic doctrines of the Conclave.

#### Daily Life
Life in Brasshaven is harsh and reverent. The city is powered by geothermal vents, roaring forges, and hissing pressure systems. Citizens wear reinforced gear, protective plating, and steam-powered exosuits to navigate the industrial landscape. The culture values endurance, sacrifice, and rigidity. Every citizen must serve a role, for idleness is treasonous.

#### Belief System
The **Credo Ferrum** — the Word of Iron — is the guiding principle. Prophets known as **Forgeseers** interpret omens in the movement of machines and the patterns of flame. Their core tenets are simple: *"Fire purifies, steam sanctifies, steel remembers."*
