# NPC Factions & Organizations

Within the Iron Accord, several powerful groups vie for influence:

- **The Chainwrights:** Elite steam engineers who wear powerful combat exosuits. They keep Brasshavenâ€™s vital systems functional and guard forbidden pre-War blueprints.
- **The Order of the Flame:** Fanatical zealots who preach a return to "sacred steel." They believe some humans are still "tainted" by digital thought and must be purified.
- **The Cogborn:** Children raised by machine-assisted forges during the war. Genetically human but culturally mechanical, they are sometimes feared by Accord purists for their innate understanding of machinery.
- **The Vane Knights:** Stoic enforcers of the Conclave, clad in sealed pressure armor. They answer only to the Forgeseers and carry out their will without question.
