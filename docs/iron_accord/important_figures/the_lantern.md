# The Lantern

## Physical Description

The Lantern is an enigmatic figure, always cloaked in a long coat of midnight blue and masked behind a polished brass visor. Their silhouette shifts between the rooftops and shadows, often glimpsed by the flicker of a battered lantern held aloft. No one can say for certain if The Lantern is young or old, man or woman. A gloved hand and a voice muffled by the mask are all that most ever see or hear.

## Public Role

A vigilante and myth, The Lantern appears in Brasshaven and the outer settlements whenever danger is greatest. Their timely interventions have foiled assassinations, broken up riots, and exposed spies lurking in the Accord’s heart. Though many doubt their existence, stories of rescue and justice grow with every telling.

## Reputation and Relationships

To the frightened, The Lantern is hope. To criminals and traitors, a warning. Marshals officially deny the vigilante’s presence, but a few have received secret help at desperate moments. The Lantern and Edraz are sometimes seen together at odd hours, trading cryptic remarks. Rumors connect The Lantern to many council members, but no proof has ever surfaced.

## History

The Lantern first appeared during the Dark Winter, when the city was beset by both famine and sabotage. Since then, generations have claimed sightings, though the person behind the mask may have changed many times. Some believe The Lantern is an inherited mantle, others that it is always the same ageless defender.

## Personality and Voice

The Lantern is silent and careful in public, speaking only when needed and never revealing true emotion. When alone with trusted allies, their wit and warmth may surface, but only for a moment. They live by a code of justice and mercy, refusing to harm the innocent or allow vengeance to consume them.

## Unique Abilities and Influence

- Appears wherever danger is greatest, seemingly able to move unseen through the city
- Inspires hope and unity among the common folk during crises
- Holds a network of secret allies and informants unknown even to the council

## Plot Immunity

The Lantern cannot be killed. If captured, unmasked, or defeated, they disappear into the shadows—often presumed dead, but always returning in a new hour of need. Their legend only grows with each retreat and return.

## Story Hooks

- The Lantern asks the players for aid in exposing a traitor among the Marshals
- After a daring rescue, The Lantern leaves behind a clue tied to their true identity
- A new vigilante claiming the name “Lantern” appears, and chaos ensues until the truth is revealed
