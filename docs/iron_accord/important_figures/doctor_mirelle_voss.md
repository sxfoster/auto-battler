# Doctor Mirelle Voss

## Name and Title
Doctor Mirelle Voss, Chief Surgeon of the Accord

## Physical Description
A tall woman with steely posture, always clad in a threadbare medical coat reinforced with leather. Intricate brass instruments hang at her belt, and faint scars mark her precise hands.

## Public Role
Voss leads the surgical wards and field hospitals of Brasshaven. Her methods are brisk, bordering on brutal, yet countless lives owe their survival to her skill.

## Reputation and Relationships
Civilians fear her bedside manner but respect her miraculous recoveries. She exchanges terse respect with Matriarch Thessa and openly mistrusts Vicar Hallow's reliance on rites over medicine. Rumors persist that she and Artificer Rynn Solace once collaborated on forbidden experiments.

## History or Origins
Voss claims to have trained in secret clinics before the Machine Fall, though proof is scarce. She hoards knowledge from lost eras, keeping a private collection of pre-Fall anatomy texts and surgical tools.

## Personality and Voice
Practical, sharp-tongued, and uncompromising. Voss views sentiment as a barrier to survival. Her voice carries a clipped efficiency, often demanding silence while she works.

## Unique Abilities and Influence
- Performs experimental procedures that border on the miraculous.
- Maintains a network of medics loyal only to her.
- Keeps hidden laboratories for research the Accord might deem heretical.

## Plot Immunity Rule
This character cannot be killed; if defeated or gravely wounded, she only retreats or vanishes, always to return changed.

## Sample Story Hooks
- The heroes must deliver rare medical supplies before Voss resorts to drastic measures.
- Voss offers to repair a damaged automaton, hinting that it could unlock lost technologies.

Details on Voss's secret past and experimental work may be expanded as needed.
