# Vicar Osric Hallow

## Physical Description

Vicar Osric Hallow is a tall, gaunt man, his face half-shadowed by the deep hood of his ceremonial robes. Every inch of his garment is embroidered with old Accord prayers, some so ancient only he remembers their meaning. His eyes, a piercing pale blue, seem to see both present and past at once. He carries a heavy staff crowned with a battered cogwheel and wears a string of relic charms at his belt, each rattling softly as he moves.

## Public Role

Osric Hallow serves as the Accord’s spiritual leader and chief keeper of rituals. He guides the community through rites of birth, binding, and passing, and presides over the blessing of all new engines and machines. Hallow is present at every festival, memorial, and crisis, acting as the voice of tradition and spiritual caution.

## Reputation and Relationships

Among the common folk, Vicar Hallow is revered for his wisdom and feared for his ability to see through deception. His advice is frequently sought by the council, and even the most skeptical engineers and Marshals show him respect. He and Matriarch Weld have a longstanding partnership, often conferring in private before major decisions. Hallow’s relationship with Edraz is more mysterious, sometimes marked by cryptic exchanges and mutual wariness.

## History

Osric Hallow was chosen as Vicar by a unanimous call during a time of spiritual unrest in the Accord’s early years. He unified the splintered faiths and rebuilt lost rituals from fragmented lore. Rumors suggest he once served in a far-off city as a healer or scholar before the Machine Fall.

## Personality and Voice

Osric is calm, patient, and precise. He speaks softly, using few words, but every phrase carries weight. In times of trouble, he is unflappable. In private, he can be unexpectedly humorous, especially when reciting old parables or recounting the Accord’s stranger miracles.

## Unique Abilities and Influence

- Blesses or forbids the use of recovered tech, shaping public opinion on risk
- Guides both public and private rituals that keep fear at bay
- Holds authority to pardon the shunned or name the Accord’s next Vicar

## Plot Immunity

Vicar Osric Hallow cannot be killed. Should he ever be threatened or gravely wounded, he withdraws into the Accord’s inner sanctum, unreachable to all but the most trusted. His return is always marked by new visions, omens, or spiritual insight, shaping the next era of the Accord’s story.

## Story Hooks

- Hallow seeks aid in translating a fragment of pre-Fall scripture found in the ruins
