# Vicar Osric Hallow

## Name and Title
Vicar Osric Hallow, Keeper of Ritual Flames

## Physical Description
A lean man draped in soot-stained vestments. His hands are perpetually smudged with ash, and his eyes glow with fervent conviction beneath a hooded cowl.

## Public Role
Hallow maintains the Accord's rites and folk rituals, presiding over blessings for everything from engines to funerals. His authority is most visible during festivals when he leads grand processions through Brasshaven.

## Reputation and Relationships
Osric commands the loyalty of the devout but draws suspicion from pragmatic engineers. He respects Matriarch Thessa Weld but questions her reluctance to fully embrace the spiritual side of the Accord. His influence often clashes with Magister Luthan Gage's more secular control of knowledge.

## History or Origins
Born to a lineage of forgemasters, Hallow rose within the clergy for his zeal and ability to weave superstition with ceremony. He is rumored to possess relics predating the Machine Fall, though he keeps them hidden.

## Personality and Voice
Passionate, intense, and theatrical. He speaks in parables and chants, invoking blessings even in casual conversation. In private he is more calculating, aware that faith can sway crowds as effectively as force.

## Unique Abilities and Influence
- Can ignite ceremonial flames said to purify machines and people alike.
- Holds sway over the Forgewardens, a militant order of ritualists.
- Uses secret rites to sanctify new inventions, claiming divine approval.

## Plot Immunity Rule

## Sample Story Hooks
- A string of mysterious engine failures draws Hallow to perform a dangerous exorcism ritual.
- He seeks assistance exposing a cult that has corrupted one of the Accord's sacred sites.
