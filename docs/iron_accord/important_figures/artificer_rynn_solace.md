# Rynn Solace, Artificer

## Summary
Rynn Solace is the Accord's most brilliant and unconventional engineer, famous for vanishing on mysterious journeys and returning with impossible inventions. Her rebellious spirit and boundless curiosity keep Brasshaven's machines runningâ€”and often push them beyond safe limits.

## Physical Description
Rynn is a slight, enigmatic figure in a patchwork coat of blue velvet and brass mesh. Quick, restless eyes constantly scan for materials, while dark hair streaked with grease frames her face. Burn scars mark her hands from countless experiments, and a bandolier of tools and trinkets never leaves her side.

Legends hint that her mind holds secrets from before the Machine Fall or something otherworldly. She maintains a deep bond with Edraz through their shared fascination with lost technology.

## Plot Hooks
