# Matriarch Thessa Weld

## Name and Title
Matriarch Thessa Weld, Last Founder of the Iron Accord

## Physical Description
A weathered yet imposing elder, Thessa stands tall in ceremonial iron-wrought robes. Her silver hair is braided with small gears and tools, and her gaze carries decades of stern judgment.

## Public Role
As the oldest surviving founder, Thessa serves as living memory and unofficial judge for all matters of Accord law and tradition. She oversees rituals, mediates disputes, and is consulted on every major decision.

## Reputation and Relationships
Thessa's wisdom is feared as much as respected. Council members seek her counsel but tread carefully around her temper. She and Vicar Osric Hallow share a complicated alliance rooted in duty rather than affection. Rumors suggest she keeps tabs on all other important figures, knowing their secrets and weaknesses.

## History or Origins
Thessa helped shape the Accord during its earliest days after the Machine Fall. Her survival through each crisis has made her a legend. Some say she witnessed the creation of the first Forgeseers, though she rarely speaks of the past.

## Personality and Voice
Blunt, austere, and meticulous. Thessa rarely wastes words and expects complete obedience when she speaks. Her tone is steeped in formality, yet occasionally softens when she recounts lost comrades.

## Unique Abilities and Influence
- Keeper of the "Iron Annals," a collection of unwritten laws remembered only by her.
- Serves as arbiter during internal conflicts, her decisions treated as final.
- Commands great respect from veteran engineers and Forgeseers alike.

## Plot Immunity Rule
This character cannot be killed; if defeated or gravely wounded, she only retreats or vanishes, always to return changed.

## Sample Story Hooks
- Thessa calls upon the heroes to retrieve a relic she claims will prevent a disastrous prophecy.
- Political rivals attempt to undermine her authority by uncovering secrets of her past.
