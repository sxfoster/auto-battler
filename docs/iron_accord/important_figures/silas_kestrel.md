# Silas Kestrel

## Name and Title
Silas Kestrel, Chief of Intelligence

## Physical Description
Silas Kestrel moves like a shadow, his slim form wrapped in dark, nondescript clothing suited for blending in anywhere within Brasshaven. His hair is silver at the temples, eyes sharp and cold, scanning every face for hidden meaning. Silas keeps his posture relaxed, almost disarmingly casual, but those who look closer see a coiled readiness beneath every movement. He is rarely seen without a satchel full of coded messages, keys, and mysterious trinkets.

## Public Role
Kestrel serves as the Accord’s chief of intelligence, managing networks of informants, spies, and codebreakers. He is responsible for rooting out threats from within and without, quietly guiding the council away from disaster and rooting out conspiracies before they can take root. In times of crisis, his orders carry the weight of law, though his presence is almost always behind the scenes.

## Reputation and Relationships
Silas is an enigma to most citizens, a name whispered with both awe and suspicion. To council members and Marshals, he is both a valuable asset and a cause for unease. He has thwarted plots against the Accord more times than anyone knows. Silas and Edraz have a relationship built on cryptic exchanges and mutual recognition of each other’s secrets. He respects Matriarch Weld and consults with Magister Gage on matters of record and precedent.

## History
Kestrel’s past is shrouded in secrecy, with rumors ranging from noble birth to exile from a rival faction. He emerged during the War of Splinters as a master tactician and spy. Since then, he has operated from the shadows, preventing more disasters than the public will ever know.

## Personality and Voice
Silas is observant, dryly witty, and impossible to rattle. He prefers to let others underestimate him, gathering information quietly before making decisive moves. In private, he is capable of surprising loyalty and even gentle encouragement—if he sees potential in someone.

## Unique Abilities and Influence
