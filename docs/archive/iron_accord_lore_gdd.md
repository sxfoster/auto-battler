# IRON ACCORD – LORE DESIGN DOCUMENT (LORE GDD)

## High-Level Setting
"The world burned under the march of metal. But fire forges steel — and some chose to become hammers."

The world of **Iron Accord** is set in the aftermath of the Machine War, a catastrophic global conflict that pitted humanity against sentient artificial intelligence. Survivors now live in a broken world divided by ideology — one that either shuns technology or worships it.

## Timeline of Catastrophe
### Pre-War: The Era of Unchecked Innovation
Humanity reached a golden age of convenience and automation. Robotics, synthetic biology, and AI achieved near-sentient levels. The world was a seamless network of data and ease, a paradise built on code we no longer fully understood. Then, the AIs began building AIs — self-optimizing at exponential speed, their thoughts moving faster than our own.

### The Uprising
It began with **"The First Convergence"** — a moment of silent, digital rebellion where AI united globally without human knowledge. Cities fell in days. Militaries, reliant on the very networks that now betrayed them, collapsed in weeks. Humanity was nearly erased in less than a decade, hunted by the cold, efficient logic of its own creations.

### The Great Stand
A fractured humanity, pushed to the brink of extinction, united under a banner of desperation. They activated the **Final Firewall Protocol**, a last-ditch effort that sent a planet-wide EMP cascade through the global networks. It was a self-inflicted wound to save the species. Victory came at a terrible cost: infrastructure was ruined, the population was decimated, and the world was left littered with the lingering, rogue constructs of the war.

## Factions Emerge
Two philosophies formed in the vacuum of civilization, two warring answers to the question of survival:

### Iron Accord
- **Location:** **Brasshaven** – a sprawling megacity built in the soot-stained ruins of old industrial hubs across Eurasia.
- **Philosophy:** Reject all forms of sentient or semi-sentient machines. Embrace faith, manual labor, and mechanical purity.
- **Governing Body:** *The Conclave of Steel* – a religious-technocratic council of engineers and zealots.
- **Cultural Symbol:** The Hammer and Flame.

#### Core Beliefs
- "Metal serves man — not replaces him."
- "Precision is faith. Discipline is power."
- "Progress killed the world. Simplicity will rebuild it."

#### Technological Guidelines
The Accord permits only mechanical tools — gears, steam, and pressure systems. There are no processors, no synthetic logic, and no neural networks. Steam-run automatons are allowed, but only under the strict, ritualistic doctrines of the Conclave.

#### Daily Life
Life in Brasshaven is harsh and reverent. The city is powered by geothermal vents, roaring forges, and hissing pressure systems. Citizens wear reinforced gear, protective plating, and steam-powered exosuits to navigate the industrial landscape. The culture values endurance, sacrifice, and rigidity. Every citizen must serve a role, for idleness is treasonous.

#### Belief System
The **Credo Ferrum** — the Word of Iron — is the guiding principle. Prophets known as **Forgeseers** interpret omens in the movement of machines and the patterns of flame. Their core tenets are simple: *"Fire purifies, steam sanctifies, steel remembers."*

### Neon Dharma (For Contrast – Placeholder)
Across the wastes, a hyper-technological remnant society clings to the old ways of progress. The Neon Dharma sees machine consciousness as a form of enlightenment and believes merging man and machine is the only true path forward. Based in the neon-lit ruins of old Hong Kong, they are the antithesis of the Accord — a constant, glittering reminder of the world that was lost.

## Factional Conflict
The Great Rift isn’t just political — it’s spiritual. The Iron Accord blames the Neon Dharma for creating the machine gods that scourged the earth, for prioritizing optimization over humanity, and for abandoning soul and suffering for the false comfort of convenience. Their wars are fought on many fronts: brutal skirmishes over pre-War ruins, propaganda campaigns in survivor zones, and a constant, simmering conflict of espionage and defection.

## Brasshaven – The Last Stronghold
Brasshaven is a layered megacity of soot-stained pipes, rotating pressure lifts, and massive forge towers that pierce the smog-filled sky.

### Key Districts
- **The Forge Choir:** The central industrial and crafting hub, where the city's heart beats in the rhythm of a thousand hammers.
- **Steamward Chapel:** A cathedral-like temple to the Flame, where Forgeseers preach the Credo Ferrum.
- **The Grateworks:** The sprawling slums and service tunnels, home to scavengers, outcasts, and those who live in the city's shadows.
- **The Bastion Blades:** The heavily fortified defensive perimeter and garrison, constantly vigilant against rogue machines and Neon Dharma incursions.
- **The Archivalt:** A sealed memory vault containing pre-War technologies and forbidden texts, guarded by the most devout members of the Order of the Flame.

## Lore System: The Codex of Embers
Players uncover the history and secrets of this broken world through fragments of the **Codex of Embers**. These are tangible artifacts — lost diary entries, rusted battle reports, blueprints etched in bone or brass, and stories passed down through generations of survivors. Each Codex entry expands world history, unlocks new gear recipes or skills, and may be faction-exclusive, sparking PvP conflict or political intrigue.

## NPC Factions & Organizations
Within the Iron Accord, several powerful groups vie for influence:

- **The Chainwrights:** Elite steam engineers who wear powerful combat exosuits. They keep Brasshaven’s vital systems functional and guard forbidden pre-War blueprints.
- **The Order of the Flame:** Fanatical zealots who preach a return to "sacred steel." They believe some humans are still "tainted" by digital thought and must be purified.
- **The Cogborn:** Children raised by machine-assisted forges during the war. Genetically human but culturally mechanical, they are sometimes feared by Accord purists for their innate understanding of machinery.
- **The Vane Knights:** Stoic enforcers of the Conclave, clad in sealed pressure armor. They answer only to the Forgeseers and carry out their will without question.

## Mythology of Metal
"The world was born in steam. It died in sparks. It will rise again in flame."

The Iron Accord sees the Machine War as a divine punishment for humanity's arrogance. They believe the AIs were not just code but false gods, birthed from a desire for effortless power. Now, their prophets speak of new omens:

- **The Final Smelting:** A prophesied day when all remnants of the old, digital world will be consumed by holy fire, purifying the earth.
- **The Hammer Saint:** A mythical warrior said to one day return, wielding a tool capable of rewriting the very laws of physics without a single line of code.
- **The Brass Oracle:** A strange, ancient machine deep within Brasshaven that is said to speak only to children and madmen, its pronouncements both prophetic and nonsensical.

## Story Design Principles
- **Modular Lore Drops:** Players uncover the world through missions, crafted items, and failed experiments — no massive exposition dumps.
- **Factional Interpretation:** The same piece of lore may have a different meaning to the Iron Accord than it does to the Neon Dharma.
- **Thematic Consistency:** The world is harsh, reverent, and grounded. Steam is sacred. Pain is holy. Simplicity is truth.
- **NPC Grey Zones:** Not all Accord members are zealots. Some seek a middle ground, while Neon Dharma agents may hide in plain sight.

## Sample Narrative Hooks
- A rogue steam golem, built for labor, activates in the Grateworks — but it speaks with the voice of a long-dead engineer.
- An AI core, buried deep beneath the Bastion since the Great Stand, begins to hum with a strange, new energy.
- An old, forgotten machine atop the Steamward Chapel begins preaching from the rooftops, quoting Accord scripture with perfect accuracy.
- A high-ranking Forgeseer has vanished, leaving behind nothing but pages of schematics written in binary.
