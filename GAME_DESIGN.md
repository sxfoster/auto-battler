# üß≠ Survival Dungeon CCG Auto-Battler ‚Äî Game Design Document

## üéØ Game Concept
A tactical survival dungeon crawler blended with collectible card game (CCG) mechanics and auto-battler combat.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat System

### Core Loop
- Auto-battle executes turns based on player-assigned ability cards.
- Characters have up to 4 ability cards from role and class pools.
- Tactical depth comes from synergy, card sequencing, and party composition.

### AI & Turn Flow
- Each character acts automatically; player controls card assignment, not moves.
- `SpeedModifier` controls action order each round.
- After every battle, party members gain Fatigue, Hunger, and Thirst.
