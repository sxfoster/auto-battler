# Auto Battler Monorepo

This repository uses an npm workspace setup to manage multiple packages:

- **react-app** – the React frontend powered by Vite
- **phaser-game** – the Phaser game logic
- **shared** – code shared between packages

Each package has its own `package.json` with basic build scripts.
