# RogueEngine - Tactical Card Game Engine

RogueEngine is a tactical card game engine built with Unity. It provides a foundation for creating roguelike/roguelite deck-builder games with strategic combat and deep card customization.

## Key Features

- **Card System:** Design and implement diverse cards, categorized into types like Ability, Equipment, etc., with varying rarities.
- **Combat System:** Engage in turn-based tactical combat, where strategic card play and positioning are key to victory.
- **Character Classes & Roles:** Create unique character classes with distinct roles, such as Tanks (absorbing damage), Healers (restoring health), DPS (dealing damage), and Support (providing buffs/debuffs).
- **Crafting System:** Implement a robust crafting system, allowing players to create items through skills like Cooking, Smithing, and Alchemy.
- **Economy:** Develop in-game currency and market systems to manage resources and trade.
- **Procedural Dungeons:** Explore dynamically generated dungeons with diverse biome themes and unpredictable events. (Refer to GAME_DESIGN.md for more details on specific biomes and events).
