# Shared

Common models and utilities consumed by both the React client and the Phaser
game.

This package contains no build step or executable scripts.

It defines data models for characters, cards, dungeons and more. The `systems`
directory provides helper modules for crafting, market transactions, biome
bonuses, floor events and enemy AI logic used by both stacks.
