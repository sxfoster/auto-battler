# Brasshaven â€“ The Last Stronghold

Brasshaven is a layered megacity of soot-stained pipes, rotating pressure lifts, and massive forge towers that pierce the smog-filled sky.

### Key Districts
- **The Forge Choir:** The central industrial and crafting hub, where the city's heart beats in the rhythm of a thousand hammers.
- **Steamward Chapel:** A cathedral-like temple to the Flame, where Forgeseers preach the Credo Ferrum.
- **The Grateworks:** The sprawling slums and service tunnels, home to scavengers, outcasts, and those who live in the city's shadows.
- **The Bastion Blades:** The heavily fortified defensive perimeter and garrison, constantly vigilant against rogue machines and Neon Dharma incursions.
- **The Archivalt:** A sealed memory vault containing pre-War technologies and forbidden texts, guarded by the most devout members of the Order of the Flame.
