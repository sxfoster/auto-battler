# Neon Dharma (Placeholder)

Across the wastes, a hyper-technological remnant society clings to the old ways of progress. The Neon Dharma sees machine consciousness as a form of enlightenment and believes merging man and machine is the only true path forward. Based in the neon-lit ruins of old Hong Kong, they are the antithesis of the Accord â€” a constant, glittering reminder of the world that was lost.
