# Guild Apprentice

## Flavor Description

You grew up in the shadow of the Great Forges, learning your trade with stained hands and aching muscles. From an early age, you were chosen by a master craftsperson and taught to respect the rules of iron, steam, and teamwork. Every tool in your kit tells a story, and every scar is a lesson. Some apprentices stay with their guild for life. Others take what they’ve learned and head out to find their own destiny.

## Typical Skills / Knowledge

- Proficiency with basic tools and machinery
- Understanding of local guild laws and etiquette
- Ability to assist in blacksmithing, repairs, or maintenance

## Starting Gear or Contacts

- Worn toolbelt and a set of trusted tools
- Badge or token showing your guild membership
- Name of a master craftsperson who can offer guidance or favors

## Roleplay Hooks / Flaws

- You have a habit of defending your guild’s honor, even when it causes trouble
- Pride in your work sometimes makes it hard to accept criticism
- You trust in rules and routines, and struggle when chaos erupts

## Example Story Hooks

- Your master has disappeared, leaving you with unfinished work and rumors of sabotage
- A rival guild accuses you of theft, putting your reputation on the line
- The Accord council calls on apprentices for a dangerous restoration project deep in forbidden ruins

## Mechanics

- Gain advantage on tasks involving basic repairs, maintenance, or operating simple machines
- Begin with a minor favor from your former master, usable once to gain advice or access
- May call on your guild’s network for information or shelter within Iron Accord territory

## Advancement Notes

As you gain experience and make your own choices, your connection to the guild may fade. Eventually, your skills and network are shaped by your actions, not your apprenticeship.
