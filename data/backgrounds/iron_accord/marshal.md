# Marshal

**Flavor Description**
You carry the weight of law on your shoulders and the trust of your settlement at your side. Marshals are both enforcers and protectors, keeping the peace with keen eyes and a steady hand. Your badge is more than a symbol; it’s a reminder that every choice you make can shape the fate of your people. Whether you learned the ropes on dusty streets or along the border, you’ve seen justice tested in the real world.

- network of informants and contacts among local watch teams

### Roleplay Hooks/Flaws
