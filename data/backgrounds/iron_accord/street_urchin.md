# Street Urchin

**Flavor Description**
You learned to survive where others looked away, making a life among back alleys, crowded markets, and forgotten corners of the settlement. Street Urchins pick up odd jobs, gather gossip, and slip through cracks in the Accord's order. Quick hands and quicker thinking have kept you fed and out of trouble, but trust is something you've had to earn, not expect.
